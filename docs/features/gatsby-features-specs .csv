Performance,3,3,0,1,"Can you build your site as 'static' files which can be deployed without a server, cached on CDN distributed throughout the globe?
<ul>
<li>Gatsby, like Jekyll and other static site generators, is built for this.</li>
<li>Squarespace allows static content but <a href=""https://developers.squarespace.com/static-pages/"">doesn't allow it</a> to be edited with the CMS.</li>
<li>WordPress allows it with <a href=""https://www.itsupportguides.com/knowledge-base/wordpress/wordpress-how-to-serve-static-content-from-a-cookieless-domain/"">some customization</a>.</li>
</ul>"
Developer Experience,3,2,2,3,"<ul>
<li>CDN-providing hosts like <a href=""https://www.netlify.com"" target=""_blank"">Netlify</a> support sites built on Gatsby and other static frameworks</li>
<li>WordPress allows this through <a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/cdn-enabler/"" target=""_blank"">plugins</a>.</li>
<li>Site builders like Squarespace usually come with a CDN out of the box.</li>
</ul>"
Accessibility,3,2,2,3,"Google's <a href=""https://www.ampproject.org/"" target=""_blank"">AMP format</a> is a specific type of static page format enabling faster loads. AMP pages are privileged in Google search results.

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/chiedo/gatsby-amp-starter-blog"" target=""_blank"">Gatsby</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/juusaw/amp-jekyll"">Jekyll</a>, and <a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/"">WordPress</a> all support this through plugins and starter kits.</li>
<li>Squarespace <a href=""https://blog.squarespace.com/blog/now-supporting-accelerated-mobile-pages"" target=""_blank"">supports this</a>.
</ul>"
Governance,3,2,2,0,"Offline access via service workers is one of the core principles of Progressive Web Apps, since many users -- especially in developing countries -- will be accessing your site over spotty connections.

Gatsby supports this out of the box; adoption is possible with <a href=""https://fossbytes.com/get-jekyll-blog-work-offline/"" target=""_blank"">Jekyll</a> and <a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/offline-content/"">WordPress</a>. Squarespace <a href=""https://answers.squarespace.com/questions/56762/i-need-to-run-a-demo-of-my-squarespace-website-offline.html"">doesn't currently support</a> any offline access."
Documentation,3,3,2,0,"<p>Fingerprinting static resources that aren't expected to change lets browsers serve content locally when a user visits a page they've already been to, as opposed to making an extra network call.</p>
<p>Gatsby and Jekyll support this out of the box, while WordPress allows this via plugins and Squarespace <a href=""https://answers.squarespace.com/questions/173452/enabling-browser-cache-for-sqaurespace-site.html"">doesn't allow it</a> at all.</p>"
Ecosystem,3,0,3,3,Extraneous code fetches are typically done by single-page applications written in various JS frameworks; on page load they fetch the code needed to run the entire application rather than just the page that's loaded. Website-building frameworks tend to be fine on this.
